# TaxoConserv: Conservation Analysis for Clinical Genetics Support

## TOOL PURPOSE & SCOPE

### Primary Objective: Conservation Analysis
TaxoConserv provides **comprehensive conservation score analysis** to support clinical genetics by:

✅ **Conservation Score Analysis**: PhyloP, GERP, phastCons scoring across taxonomic groups
✅ **Variant-Level Conservation**: Detailed conservation patterns for specific genomic positions
✅ **Taxonomic Comparison**: Cross-species conservation patterns (primate, mammal, vertebrate)
✅ **Statistical Analysis**: Robust statistical comparison between conservation levels
✅ **Research Support**: Evidence base for ACMG PP3/BP4 conservation criteria

### NOT an ACMG Classification Tool
❌ **NOT**: Automatic pathogenicity prediction
❌ **NOT**: Clinical variant classification
❌ **NOT**: ACMG criteria scoring system
❌ **NOT**: Replacement for clinical interpretation

### Role in Clinical Genetics Workflow
TaxoConserv provides **conservation evidence** that clinical geneticists can use as **supporting information** for ACMG criteria PP3/BP4:

- **PP3**: Multiple lines of computational evidence support deleterious effect
- **BP4**: Multiple lines of computational evidence suggest no impact

## CLINICAL GENETICS INTEGRATION

### Supporting ACMG Criteria PP3/BP4

**PP3 Application**: "Multiple lines of computational evidence support a deleterious effect"
- High conservation across multiple taxonomic groups
- Significant deviation from background conservation
- Consistent conservation patterns across related species

**BP4 Application**: "Multiple lines of computational evidence suggest no impact"
- Low conservation scores across taxonomic groups
- Conservation levels consistent with neutral variation
- Lack of evolutionary constraint evidence

### Integration with Clinical Workflow

1. **Variant Prioritization**
   - Filter variants by conservation significance
   - Rank variants by cross-taxonomic conservation
   - Identify highly conserved positions for follow-up

2. **Evidence Documentation**
   - Generate conservation evidence reports
   - Provide statistical backing for conservation claims
   - Export data for clinical genetics reports

3. **Research Support**
   - Analyze conservation patterns in gene panels
   - Compare conservation across disease-associated variants
   - Support variant interpretation research
